<h2 id="huh-">Huh?</h2>
<p><strong>2UN ðŸ”´ LTD</strong> is a website that asks if you&#39;re ready for this. If you are ready for this, appropriate measures will be taken. But only for 1.5 seconds at a time.</p>
<h2 id="uhhhhhhhhhh-huh-">Uhhhhhhhhhh... huh?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s a site that plays 2 Unlimited&#39;s &quot;Get Ready For This&quot; while showing you videos off people dancing.</p>
<h2 id="yeahhhhhh-so-huh-">Yeahhhhhh, so... huh?</h2>
<p>Look, I found out the domain <code>2un.ltd</code> was available for $3 so I bought it. At that point I had to actually make something with it.</p>
<h2 id="so-who-made-this-thing-">So who made this thing?</h2>
<p><a href="http://ahoylemon.xyz">Lemon</a> made this one himself. 2 Unlimited was not involved. Lemon has also made other sites of equal usefulness in case you want to <a href="http://ahoylemon.xyz">look at those</a>.</p>
