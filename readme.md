#### Are you all ready for this?

## Huh?
**2UN ðŸ”´ LTD** is a website that asks if you're ready for this. If you are ready for this, appropriate measures will be taken. But only for 1.5 seconds at a time.

## Uhhhhhhhhhh... huh?
It's a site that plays 2 Unlimited's "Get Ready For This" while showing you videos off people dancing.

## Yeahhhhhh, so... huh?
Look, I found out the domain `2un.ltd` was available for $3 so I bought it. At that point I had to actually make something with it.

## So who made this thing?
[Lemon](http://ahoylemon.xyz) made this one himself. 2 Unlimited was not involved. Lemon has also made other sites of equal usefulness in case you want to [look at those](http://ahoylemon.xyz).

## Where did these videos come from?
* YouTube List goes here

## This is dumb, why do you waste your time making this stuff?
Mom?
